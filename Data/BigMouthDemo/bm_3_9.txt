I think that's the sound it makes? Dr.Engel, I'm concerned about Jay's ability to focus.Jay, honey, why don't you tell the doctor what a school day's like for you? Well, first, I'm always super late to homeroom.Then I pick at my skin until it bleeds, at which point I start drumming relentlessly.Once Miss Benitez kicks me out, that's around when I, quote, "lose time." I come to and it's assistant principal's office, principal's office, drink cups of stuff on a dare.And then I usually stare out the window at a bird and I wonder, "What if I was that bird?

I know.If I'm not the smartest person in our grade, then, well, who who the heck am I? I'll tell you who I am! Someone who has earned the respect of people with no teeth.Jesus, this blog says Malala didn't get into Yale 'cause she didn't have enough extracurriculars.How do you get on blogs? What? That's your fucking question? Well, I mean, are they different from websites? I shouldn't have to explain this to you.Shred those shanks.Please.This was great for taking the test, but now I need to go to sleep. My mind feels insane. 
Sleep is for the weak, like Jimmy Smits who doesn't deserve to eat the shit out of Andy Garcia's smooth Cuban butt.What?

I've made a dark and difficult decision.I'd like one large Adderall, please.What? Why? You're, like, already smart.Well, that's what I thought, but then everyone started doin' drugs, and now I feel like I'm being left behind.Oh, yeah, I get that.Like your family fumigated your house and went on vacation without you.Uh, I don't really relate to that.So you moved into a new house that's full of love, but really you just wanna live like a beaten pig.I think we're going through two different things here.I was really just hoping to buy a study drug from you.Missy, I care too much about you as a friend, so I can't sell you a pill at full price.Are you sure it's okay I'm taking your medicine?
