# SSEA-Text-as-Data-Workshop

I provide the code and slides from the Text Mining Tools for Narrative Analysis and Other Mixed-Method Research pre-conference workshop I gave at the 2021 Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood. The code walks through basic token count and topic model analyses and slides cover some basic topic modeling informaiton and pre-processing choices.
